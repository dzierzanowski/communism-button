# Communism Button

A progressive web app which provides instant communism at the push of a button.

## Inspiration

Tired of "communism button" apps playing a 30 second ad after just 5 seconds of communism? Yeah, me too.
What sort of communism is it, which puts capitalism first?! Here's a true communism button
app, where you can get as much communism as you like, distraction-free.
