# Communism Button

A progressive web app (PWA) which provides instant communism at the push of a
button.

**Launch it here: [ðŸ‘‰ Communism Button ðŸ‘ˆ](https://dzierzanowski.github.io/communism-button/)**

This application is a tiny showcase and an exercise of progressive web
applications and [neumorphism](https://neumorphism.com/) design.

## Inspiration

Tired of "communism button" apps playing a 30 second ad after just 5 seconds of
communism? Yeah, me too. What sort of communism is it, which puts capitalism
first?! Here's a true communism button app, where you can get as much communism
as you like, without boosting anyone's capital.
